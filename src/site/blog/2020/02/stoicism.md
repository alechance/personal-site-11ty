I've been focused on financial independence for the last couple of years - budgeting, living within your means, increasing your income while keeping your expenses low. I've done pretty well - I'm much more secure with my money now and I've got a buffer so I don't need to worry about this month or next month's bills etc.

But it's easy to get obsessed with increasing your net worth, as if that in itself will make you happy. It doesn't. If you're obsessed with growth, you are always looking at what is next, not appreciating what you have now.

I came across this [post about stoicism on the Mr Money Mustache blog](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/02/what-is-stoicism-and-how-can-it-turn-your-life-to-solid-gold/), and ended up listening to the audiobook of A Guide to the Good Life, The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine.

The main takeaways:
- negative visualisation - be thankful for the things you have by imagining not having them
- put yourself outside of your comfort zone - this will make you more comfortable in more situations
- know that it is your reaction to things, not the things themselves, that affect how you feel. You are in charge of how you feel.
