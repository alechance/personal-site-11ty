I've never been much of a bookworm. When I was younger, I was always more interested in playing video games, surfing the internet and listening to podcasts. My attention never stretched far enough to get through a book.

Every so often, I decide I want to be a 'book person', and I try to force myself to read.

My latest attempt is a bit different, because I'm trying to incorporate some of the techniques that have worked for my exercise routine:
- logging the time spent training
- having a positive feedback loop
