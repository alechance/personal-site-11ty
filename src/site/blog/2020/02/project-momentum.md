I've been working on a project on and off for the last year or so. I've gone through cycles of:
- motivation - I'm passionate about this and I feel driven to work on it
- demotivation - I can't be bothered / it's not worth the effort

The project is a website to help music fans support the artists they love. It's a payment platform set up with Stripe Connect that lets music fans pay artists based on how much they listen to the artist on streaming services. I think it's a good idea.
