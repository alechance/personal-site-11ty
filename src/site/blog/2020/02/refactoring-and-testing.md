I'm not a very careful programmer. I care more about getting things done and working on cool new ideas than meticulously refactoring and testing code.

But I want to change. If I'm going to make a real career out of this, I need to level up and get more comfortable refactoring code and making it more reliable.

I just watched [this great talk on YouTube by Sandi Metz - Get a Whiff of This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU). It's from RailsConf 2016 and it's about code smells.

Metz introduces the code smells introduced by Martin Fowler in his book [Refactoring](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134757599?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0134757599). She groups them into five categories:
- Bloaters
- Tool abusers
- Change preventers
- Couplers
- Dispensables

She then demonstrates how these code smells can be fixed using refactoring recipes. They are mechanical, concrete techniques for solving these problems - you don't need to reinvent the wheel.

It's pretty exciting that there is a limited number of techniques that will solve many problems, and that they all have names - it makes the whole thing less wishy washy.

Anyway, I'm going to make it a goal of mine this year to read [Refactoring](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134757599?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0134757599) and learn some of these techniques.

If you have any tips, please send them my way.
