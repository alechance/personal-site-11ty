I'm not much of an exercise person, but I've managed to get into the habit of riding a stationary bike every day since 31 December. I've managed to fit it into my routine so that it's sustainable.

### Getting started

I got started by purchasing a Fitbit - a Fitbit Inspire HR. It tracks your heart rate and reminds you to get up and move every hour.

I didn't think I would like it as much as I do. Seeing my resting heart rate drop from the mid 70s to the mid 50s has been a great positive feedback loop.

I've also been taking a photo of the meter on the bike, then logging it into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It has a graph with distance in bars and a line graph of my average speed overlaid:

This has been great for keeping progression at the front of my mind - I don't want the graph to be pointing down, so I need to keep improving.

### Mind games

I've played around with a few different ways to stay motivated when I'm on the bike. This includes:
- setting a target speed. For a while, this was 40km/h. It's good if it's easy to convert into fractions - for example, 40 is two thirds of 60, so one kilometre is 90 seconds. If you're at the 3 minute mark, you should be around 2 kilometres, etc.
- racing against your target speed. Following on from the above point, if it's been 21 minutes and you're at 15km, that means you're a full kilometre or 90 seconds ahead of your target speed (21 minutes at 40km/h = 14km)
