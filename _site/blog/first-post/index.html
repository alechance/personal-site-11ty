<h2>Playing with Eleventy</h2>
<p>Posted on 17th January 2020</p>
<p>This thing is cool! I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8mJrhhdHWc">Jason Lengstorf's stream with Zach Leatherman</a> which is a good starting point for people who are new to Eleventy.</p>
<p>What I like so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>there isn't any boilerplate code - your code is as small as your website is. Zach said in the stream above that he can't work out what sites have been made with Eleventy - it just exports the templates that you write.</li>
<li>the data cascade feels powerful - I can declare data in one place then use it somewhere else. This means</li>
</ul>
