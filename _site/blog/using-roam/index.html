<h2>Using Roam</h2>
<p>Posted on 17th January 2020</p>
<p>I've been using Roam since the end of last year to take notes. This has replaced my system of hand-writing notes, which then go into a pile of papers on my desk. It's an obvious improvement over that, but I feel like I haven't taken full advantage of its potential.</p>
